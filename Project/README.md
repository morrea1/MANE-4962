# Optimizing Manufacturing Operations Using Machine Learning 
Alex Morreale

Using a continuous manufacturing dataset, the goal was to predict outputs based on features for the factory, and three machines in series. 

The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/supergus/multistage-continuousflow-manufacturing-process?resource=download

A linear regression model and a random forest model were used, with hyperparameter tuning done on the random forest. Additionally, a lightweight model was created. 

The code can be run in google colab, using the dataset found on Kaggle. 

Results were a model that underperformed on the data set, but showed hope for future exploration with this data. Additionally, the dataset comes already preprocessed and ready for use in any model.

In this codebase, the data is scaled using a standard scaler.
